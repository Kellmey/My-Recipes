    <h2>Fish Curry</h2>

    <p>Fish curry made with fresh fish,onions, tomatoes, coconut, spices and herbs. Make the easiest, delicous and flavoursome fish curry with my easy step by step recipe. Also known as Indian fish masala it is a sea food lover's favourite. Fish curry is a staple in a lot af Asian countries and is made in varous ways using many different locally available ingredients like coconut, poppy seeds, tamarind etc. </p>

    <p>While you can make a fish curry with any kind of fish available, river wate fish also known as freshwater fish is the best as they go well in a curry. I know a lot of us dont have access to freshwater fish but trust me they make a lot of difference to a curry.This fish curry tastes best with plain steamed rice, flavoured rice like jeera rice , ghee rice or with roti, paratha and naan</p>
